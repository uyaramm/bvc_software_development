        Ayrton Senna da Silva (21 March 1960 - 1 May 1994) was a Brazilian
        racing driver who won the Formula 1 World Drivers' Championship in 1988,
        1990, and 1991.

        From the Santana neighborhood at S√£o Paulo, Ayrton Senna was born on
        March 21, 1960, with the speed running through his veins. Encouraged by
        his father (Mr. Milton), at the age of 4, he already had an incredible
        ability with Kart and, from there, the passion for the accelerated
        engine only increased. At age of 9, he was driving jeeps with a
        dexterity characteristic of a lot of experience; at 13, he already
        competed officially. He finished at second place several times, which
        was not enough. That was when, in 1977, he could feel for the first time
        the taste of a victory - and decide that he belonged there.

      <p>
        Senna's development as a pilot started in his childhood, as the inspired
        boy dedicated several hours of his days training. In 1981, he started
        competing in Europe, winning the English Formula 1600 Championship -
        with a record of 12 wins in 20 races. It was during this period that he
        decided to use his mother's maiden name, Senna, because Silva is a very
        common name in Brazil. In 1983, he won the British Formula 3
        championship with the Dick Bennets team, with 13 wins in 21 races, 9 of
        them in a row. He also won the Macau Grand Prix for Teddy Yip's Theodore
        Racing Team. The pilot was in top form and in an impressive rise -
        absolutely nothing was taking him away from the focus he had.

        Ayrton Senna's extraordinary feats at the wheel of a racing car yielded
        three world championship titles and 41 grand prix victories. He was
        probably the greatest exponent of the flat-out qualifying lap the sport
        has ever seen, taking 65 pole positions in 162 races. These achievements
        alone ensured his name would be forever writ large in the history books
        long before the tragic circumstances of his death while leading the 1994
        San Marino Grand Prix.
