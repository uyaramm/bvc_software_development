      The previous day, Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger had died when his
      car crashed during qualification for the race. His and Senna's crashes
      were the worst of several that took place that weekend (including a
      serious one involving Rubens Barrichello) and were the first fatal
      collisions to occur during a Formula 1 race meeting in 12 years and not
      repeated until the fatal crash of Jules Bianchi at the 2014 Japanese Grand
      Prix at Suzuka Circuit.

      This became a turning point in the safety of Formula 1, prompting the
      implementation of new safety measures in both Formula 1 and the circuit,
      as well as the Grand Prix Drivers' Association to be reestablished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Supreme Court of Cassation of Italy ruled that mechanical failure was
      the cause of the crash.
