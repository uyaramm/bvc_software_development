      <h2 title="South America Country">I'm from Brazil</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Brazil is the largest country in South America in terms of land area and
        one of the most populous as well. Portuguese is the offical language
        spoken there.
        <br />
        It has an enourmous cultural,ethnic, religious diversity. The country is
        very rich in natural aspects, such as vegetation, climate, fauna and
        flora.

        I could share countless images of stunning places. There a lot to do
        there! I love going to the beaches and this special one is called
        Fernando de Noronha, located in Pernambuco.

        Here in Alberta, there are a splendid places to go, such as Moraine
        Lake, for now, my favourite lake.<br />
        However, the place I'm going the most is
