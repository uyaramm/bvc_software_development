          Colosseum: is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome,
          Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient
          amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing
          amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. It could hold an
          estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its
          history,having an average audience of some 65,000; It was used for
          gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts,
          executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman
          mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to be
          used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused
          for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious
          order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.
